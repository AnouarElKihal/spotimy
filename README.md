# SPOTIMY
This is my simplified version of Spotify. 
This project utilizes the [Spotify Scraper API](https://rapidapi.com/DataFanatic/api/spotify-scraper/) from Rapid API to fetch data about songs on Spotify/Youtube, 
including audio, title, song cover and duration. The Spotify Scraper API offers an easy-to-use json response to access this information.<br>
